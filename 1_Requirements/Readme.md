   Presence of fraudulent activities internally and externally, the online review system cannot fully support the business. The organizations that get low score reviews are prompted to raise their score for the market competition by paying the platform for editing and deleting the posted feedback or reviews. Furthermore, the automatic filtration system of a platform removes some thoughts without the realization of the users. The low transparency platform causes low validity towards the reviews. Blockchain technology provides exceptionally high transparency since every action can be traced publicly.
